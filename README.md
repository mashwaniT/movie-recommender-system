# Medical Diagnosis using The National Institutes of Health Chest X-ray Dataset.

## Abstract

For my CP322 final project, I decided to build a machine learning algorithm to help doctors accurately diagnose lung diseases such as pneumonia, lung nodules and other diseases.

There are roughly 100,000 unique x-ray images contained in the dataset each labelled with diagnoses of different lung diseases.

The methodology will go as follows:

- Preprocessing the dataset by resizing the images to a uniform size, converting to greyscale, then normalizing the pixel values

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, 70-30

- Selecting a machine learning algorithm for image classification to train the dataset. Choice between Convolutional Neural Network, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine

- Train the selected algorithm on the training dataset using preprocessed images

- Evaluate performance of the algorithm on the testing dataset using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score

- Tune hyperparameters if needed to achieve desired results

- Once desired performance is attained, we can use it to make predictions on new, unseen chest x-ray images.
